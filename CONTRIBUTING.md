<h1 align="center">🔖 About lazyCode</h1>

Taking into account every developer’s zeal to create a competitive coding/DSA repository that not just stands out from the crowd but leaves everyone gaping wide-mouthed with just a single glance, <b>lazyCode</b> will act as your go-to project by providing you with a website template that leaves anyone who looks at it awe-inspired.

<h2 align="center">🎯 Additional Information 🎯</h2>
 
- Keeping beginners in mind and ensuring that young talented newcomers make notable contributions to their first open-source project, things have been kept simple for now. The project will be made using **HTML**, **CSS** and a modest amount of **JavaScript**.
- lazyCode will be taken a step further after the Hacktoberfest by making it with **React** and adding exciting functionality. For now it will remain centred on creating a simple template which can be cloned and used to update one's own codes.
- With time and your ample contributions, lazyCode aims to evolve into a *web-app* where everyone can upload their unique codes, share them and discuss about them.

#### 🧑‍💻 Open-source contributions are a great way for developers to improve the software they rely upon, hone technical as well as soft skills and most importantly build experiences and communities that are cherished for a lifetime. 
 
#### 🎯 During the entire month of October 2021, all you have to do is open at least 4 pull requests. Complete the 2021 challenge and earn a limited edition T-shirt. You can even opt for having a tree 🌲 planted in your name instead of receiving t-shirt as swag in order to make Hacktoberfest 2021 more carbon neutral.
