Hey there, my amigos,:wave: this open source project is different because we're taking your obsession with creating your Competitive coding / DSA GitHub repo to the next level by providing you with a full blown awesome beautiful amazing (okay, that's enough I guess) website template for your own website repository, where you could see your code shimmering like diamonds getting all of your undivided attention.  
But, hold on, what's that?
What's the greatest place to seek for anything like that? Who will be the one to bring it to us?  
You, amigo, are the answer. Why wait for others to provide you with whatever you want if you have the imagination and the necessary skills? Go get it if you want something. (Enough with the motivational speeches, please. :trollface:)  
So, without further ado, let's get started.

## What more you should know :question:

- Everything will be done with HTML, CSS, and probably some javascript for good measure. Yes, react will be a better option for this, however, for the time being, this project wants young talented minds to apply their abilities and make substantial contributions to their first open source project while having fun, so why not keep things simple for now? After the hacktoberfest celebrations, we will move up a step and make this project with react while also adding some crazy functionality.
- During the hactoberfest season We're aiming to make a simple template so that you can clone and update your own codes with that hosting in your github pages for the duration of hactober fest, but as time goes on, we're aiming to make this a one-of-a-kind repository (web app) where you can all upload your unique codes under your wonderful names, share them, chat with others about codes, and have fun.
- Last but not least, here are the [designs](https://www.figma.com/file/nhmSygpLCznrCwPBmYEjdK/lazyCode?node-id=0%3A1) to get you started on this exciting trip :tada:.
